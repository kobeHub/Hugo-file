I am Inno Jia. A junior in [School of Software, Shandong University](http://www.sc.sdu.edu.cn/). I will graduate in 2020. 

My major is Artificial Intelligence, and my interests focus on machine learning and algorithm. Now my work is mainly at signal processing. I am a programming enthusiast and willing to share and discuss.

I am a typical user of Python, and my favorite static language is Golang. In many ways, I like to learn various programming languages and skills. At present, I'm working on Golang and Rust.
